== Description ==

Enables an editable description for a post type to display at the top of the post type archive page. Output the description via the native `the_archive_description()` function that already works with a taxonomy term descriptions.

Automatically works for any theme that uses `the_archive_description()` (added in WordPress 4.1) like [Twenty Fifteen](https://wordpress.org/themes/twentyfifteen/), [Twenty Sixteen](https://wordpress.org/themes/twentysixteen/), [Twenty Seventeen](https://wordpress.org/themes/twentyseventeen/) or most  [_s-based themes](https://underscores.me).

1. Search for "Post Type Archive Descriptions."

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is this plugin compatible with WordPress 5.0 / "Gutenberg"? =
Yes. The plugin does not directly integrate with the post editor screen so no changes were required.

Be aware that as of 5 Dec 2019, it [appears the Twenty Nineteen theme will *not* support post type archive descriptions by default](https://github.com/WordPress/twentynineteen/issues/256). Unless something changes, you will need to manually add support for them in a child theme if using Twenty Nineteen. See the next FAQ for how to do that.

= How do I display a custom post type's description? =

In WordPress 4.1, [`the_archive_description()`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/the_archive_description/) and [`get_the_archive_description()`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/get_the_archive_description/) were introduced. As long as your theme supports those functions, you don't have to do anything!

Older themes can use `ptad_get_post_type_description()` or `ptad_the_post_type_description()` to return or echo a post type description. Both functions take an optional `$post_type` slug argument to return a specific post type. However, that is unnecesarry on a page that returns `true` for is_post_type_archive()`.

Chances are you want this in the `archive-{post_type_slug}.php` or `archive.php` template files.

= Which post types get a description? =

By default, any custom post type excluding Posts and Pages that was registered with `'has_archive' => true`. There is a filter (see below) to add support for *any* post type.

= Are there filters & actions to modify the plugin? =

Glad you asked. Yes. Plenty!

Filters:

- `ptad_post_types` - specify the post types with a description (default is all non-built_in post types where `has_archive` is true)
- `ptad_admin_title` - Modify admin page title
- `ptad_menu_label` - Modify the menu item label in the admin
- `ptad_description_capability` - Set capability of who can edit descriptions. Default: `edit_posts`
- `ptad_edit_description_link` - Modify admin bar link to edit the description
- `ptad_view_archive_link` - Modify admin bar link to view the post type archive

Actions:

- `ptad_before_editor` - Between title and description editor for ALL admin pages. Receives `$post_type` arg.
- `ptad_before_editor_{post_type}` - Between title and description editor for any specific post type.
- `ptad_after_editor` - Immediately below description editor for ALL admin pages. Receives `$post_type` arg.
- `ptad_after_editor_{post_type}` -  Immediately below description editor for any specific post type.

== Screenshots ==

1. The editing interface for writing a post type archive description. This plugin adds the "Archive Description" link in the left menu, the "View Books Archive" link in the admin bar, and, of course, the field to save the description.

2. The post type archive description displayed (automatically!) in the Twenty Fifteen theme. The plugin also adds the "Edit Books Description" link.
